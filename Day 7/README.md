Day 7,

Finally created a bitcoin tracker which I failed on day 3.

Day 6 helped me learned how to implement API's

Used coindesk's API to track bitcoin price.

The ticker ticks every minute, since the API only updates the price every minute.

Was a little perfectionist with the CSS styles, but decided it was nice enough to upload. Most of the time was spent there...

Time taken: 23:45-1:40
