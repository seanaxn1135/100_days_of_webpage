100 days 100 webpages

Hello! Welcome to my 100 webpage in 100 days project.

In this project, I'll try to create 100 websites in 100 days. 

I upload a new website everyday and try to only spend one hour each day to avoid dropping into the perfectionism rabbit hole (this often happens to me when dealing with design related things).


This project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days project: https://jenniferdewalt.com/. A video I watched mentioned the importance of quantity projects. 
Creating as many things so that you get good at it, regardless of quality. This helps us get started with projects we would otherwise not have started, 
thinking that we are not qualified to start, or that the quality won't be up to par. Thus the start of this project!

Follow me on this project if you would like to see me build ugly, unresponsive webpages that I think would be fun and useful to build, and hopefully improve over time!
