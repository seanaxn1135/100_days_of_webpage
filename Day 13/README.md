Day 13,

Planned to be a more relaxed day since I have other things to do.

Wanted to create a snail that would follow you and create more snails when clicked.

The snails did get created when clicked, but not where I want the snails to be, and the newly created snails won't move. Probably because the eventlistener only listens to events from the creation of the document. Would need to read up more about it.

Planned on making the snail look at cursor but that would take time to implement.

Might be looking into objects and animation in the following days

Time taken: 18:00 - 18:30
