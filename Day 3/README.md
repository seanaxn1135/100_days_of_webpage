Day 3:

I spent a lot more time today on things that were a little to hard for me.

I tried to create a webapp that will track the price of bitcoin live. I tried using Node.js but couldn't do it.

I later changed my idea to a pomodoro timer after failing my first idea. Being tired and looking on the web for ideas, I noticed that a stopwatch app on Javascript is not very easy to do...

I gave up on that as well, I thought about the next Bitcoin halving and thought I would create a timer.


This website uses the current date and deducts it from a second date (next bitcoin halving)

I would have done more, such as continuous updates and included other denominations of time but honestly I am just too tired now, I've spent more than 3 hours on today's work. Spending time doing things that are too hard for me.

I think I will focus more website design (HTML & CSS) rather than javascript in the following days...


Time taken: 3:15 - 6:30
