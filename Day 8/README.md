Day 8,

Followed a guide: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc9rgFHr098

Email forms will be useful later on if I were to expand the website. Might learn the backend in the later days on how to automatically send messages to my email.

Thinking about it, sending an email might be a problem since netlify (the hosting service I am using) only allows for static webpages, which might be an issue for backend. Need to study a little more into it.
