Day 10,

Wanted to learn a little bit of CSS animation and drawing.

Followed this video to draw a cat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uw0zGRwoQ

Wanted to animate the cat to eat the fish (the fish is draggable btw) and expand eyes when fish is close to cat. But I was taking too long with this project.

Time taken: 12:50-15:10
