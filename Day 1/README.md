Day 1:

I try to create a new website everyday for 100 days. This project is to help me refresh HTML and CSS skills while trying to apply JavaScript which I have learned.
This project can also help me familiarize with GitHub and version control.

I'll try to limit myself to 1 hour everyday, this is to ensure that I do not end up trying to make the perfect website and just do it.

This is the homepage of the website, I had trouble aligning the content page with the header. I wanted to add links such as blog and contact me page. Might add them in another day.

This project was inspired by Jennifer Dewalt's 180 websites in 180 days

I don't think I have 180 days to code since my final year exams would be then and I would be pretty busy. Thus 100 days (and its a nice number).

Time-taken: 15:45 - 17:00
