Day 9,

Created a word counter application that count words, characters, reading time, and speaking time. 

Wanted to do sentences and paragraphs but noticed that it wasn't as easy as it looks (not just counting fullstops.)

The website's inspiration came from https://wordcounter.net/

I had to see if the sentence started with a capital letter and such, felt that I needed a lot of time.

Nevertheless, I overshot my timing again today. CSS takes wayyy too much time :(

Time taken: 18:45-21:30
