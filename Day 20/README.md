Day 20,

A quick webpage to tell u what is the current weather.

The background image is supposed to change with the weather, but sometimes it fails to load.

Used API from https://openweathermap.org/

Edit: Sadly, I noticed that my personal API key would be public. This is not really a problem for me, but I do not know if theres any sort of regulations behind this. Removed history and API for safety.

Time-taken: 11:00 - 11:50
